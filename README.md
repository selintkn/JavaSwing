This project implements a desktop student management system using Java Swing.
Student records are displayed in a JTable, with data dynamically loaded from a text file and stored using a DefaultTableModel.
The application supports adding and deleting students, querying grades (maximum, average, and threshold-based counts), and saving updated data back to a file through a menu-based graphical interface.
